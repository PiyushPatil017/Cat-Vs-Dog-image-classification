# Cat-Vs-Dog-image-classification
Binary Image Classification 

This is a cat vs dog image classification project that utilises the concept of Convolution Neural Network (CNN). The dataset was used from Kaggle (link provided) and the project was carried out on Google Colab. The dataset was available in zip format which was extracted using zipfile module followed by extraction of training and testing data from folders. The model parameters were selected by hypertuning using keras_tuner which resulted in an validation accuracy of 0.8946 and validation loss of 0.2739
